## Project status

Hey ðŸ‘‹

As I'm currently getting some non-developer traffic I feel like I should make some things clear.

1. **This project is currently unmaintained** - I only put the code here to prove a point. The code is ugly and it's barely good enough to run. I won't be making any improvements or keeping it up to date.
2. **Not for casual use** - the instructions below are for developers. I'm not providing any builds/binaries or user support. Some common questions are answered in the issue section.
3. **Feel free to fork** - if you are a developer and would like to maintain a more up-to-date version feel free to make a fork.

There's a fork by QuickNET-Tech here: https://github.com/QuickNET-Tech/GTAO_Booster_PoC He already made several improvements. I have not verified his builds, use at your own risk, but the guy seems ok.

## PoC that fixes two GTA Online bugs and drastically improves load times for CPU-bound systems

Original work by tostercx, massive thanks to them

All addresses are found at run time so that it works on all platforms

While chances are low, modifying your game while in online mode might get your account suspended, use at your own risk!

Inject the dll found in [releases](https://github.com/QuickNET-Tech/GTAO_Booster_PoC/releases) with a DLL injector of your choice and then just head online  
NOTE : You can inject whenever you want as long as GTA5.exe is running and before you've started to head online

## How to

* `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/QuickNET-Tech/GTAO_Booster_PoC`
* build the project with MSVC
* inject the DLL with your favorite injector while the game is starting up

or

* in visual studio start a new project and provide a link to this repository
